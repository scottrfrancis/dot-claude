      From the session log above, extract the architectural decisions and format them as proper ADRs.
      
      For each significant decision, create an ADR following this template:
      
      # ADR-XXX: [Title]
      
      ## Status
      Proposed
      
      ## Context
      What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
      
      ## Decision
      What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
      
      ## Consequences
      What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
      
      ### Positive
      - List positive consequences
      
      ### Negative  
      - List negative consequences
      
      ### Neutral
      - List neutral consequences
      
      ## Alternatives Considered
      - What other options were evaluated?
      
      ---
      
      Generate one or more ADRs based on the key decisions found in the log.
      Use concrete, specific language and focus on architectural significance.
