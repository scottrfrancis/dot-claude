      Analyze our conversation and create a structured summary for future reference.
      ${topic:+The topic is: $topic}
      ${adr:+Pay special attention to architectural decisions that might warrant ADRs.}

      Focus on:
      1. Key technical decisions made and their rationale
      2. Trade-offs considered
      3. Patterns or best practices identified
      4. Problems solved and approaches taken
      5. Potential improvements or follow-up items
      6. Any decisions that might warrant formal ADRs

      Format the output as markdown with these sections:
      - Summary (2-3 sentences)
      - Key Decisions (with rationale and trade-offs)
      - Technical Insights (patterns, gotchas, learnings)
      - Code Patterns (reusable patterns identified)
      - Potential ADRs (decisions needing formal documentation)
      - Follow-up Items (unresolved questions, future improvements)

      Be specific and include concrete examples where relevant.
      Focus on reusable insights rather than project-specific details.
